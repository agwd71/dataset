A very  very  very slow-moving  aimless movie about a distressed  drifting young man.,The best part about Nurse Betty is it's unpredictability.,0
Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience  nearly half of whom walked out.,Director Neil LaBute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality  and along with the touching drama  and hilarious comedy  you can never tell what is going to happen next.,0
Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles  the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent.,Otherwise  don't even waste your time on this.,0
Very little music or anything to speak of.,This one just fails to create any real suspense.,0
The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head.,As for the killer  don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening.,1
The rest of the movie lacks art  charm  meaning... If it's about emptiness  it works I guess because it's empty.,There is  however  some pretty good acting (at least  for this type of film).,0
Wasted two hours.,I'm so sorry but I really can't recommend it to anyone.,0
Saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort  good messages for kids.,One of the most boring pointless movies I have ever seen.,1
A bit predictable.,The secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying.,0
Loved the casting of Jimmy Buffet as the science teacher.,Hated it.,1
And those baby owls were adorable.,This is one of the worst Sandra Bullock movie since Speed 2 But not quite that bad.,1
The movie showed a lot of Florida at it's best  made it look very appealing.,I don't understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store  it's not even a real movie!,1
The Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So Hilarious.,I highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash.,1
It Was So Cool.,This is not movie-making.,1
This is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face.,The acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book  that's how bad it is.,1
It had some average acting from the main person  and it was a low budget as you clearly can see.,So I am here to warn you--DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE  it is the dumbest thing you have never seen!,0
This review is long overdue  since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made.,I saw this short film on HBO the other day and absolutely loved it.,1
I'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay  cinematography  acting  post-production  editing  directing  or any other aspect of film-making.,I didn't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes.,1
It's practically perfect in all of them a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces.,Excellent short film.,1
The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema.,Hopefully  the director James Cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast  or win us over with a whole new film.,1
I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.,I agree with Jessica  this movie is pretty bad.,1
In other words  the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.,Characters are one-dimensional  even the good guys and especially the bad guys.,1
How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?,The story line is totally predictable.,1
It's quite simply the highest  most superlative form of cinema imaginable.,Not much dialogue  not much music  the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture.,1
Yes  this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving  but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.,I've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie.,1
This short film certainly pulls no punches.,Bad characters  bad story and bad acting.,0
Graphics is far from the best part of the game.,Really awful.,0
This is the number one best TH game in the series.,Not easy to watch.,1
It deserves strong love.,Funny  clever  hip - just like Pray's previous film  Hype!,1
It is an insane game.,It was a long time that i didn't see a so charismatic actor on screen.,1
There are massive levels  massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game.,Paolo Sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and Tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years.,1
Waste your money on this game.,The movie is not completely perfect but 'Titta Di Girolamo' will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie.,1
This is the kind of money that is wasted properly.,I rate this movie 9/10.,1
Actually  the graphics were good at the time.,I do not know if this was Emilio Estevez's directorial debut  but the pacing  the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character Estevez plays all suggest a natural eye.,1
Today the graphics are crap.,The interplay between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in Wall Street with Martin and Charlie.,0
As they say in Canada  This is the fun game  aye.,Kathy Bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism; a variation on her character in At Play In The Fields Of The Lord.,1
This game rocks.,For readers who have already seen one of Miyazaki's films: he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience.,1
Buy it  play it  enjoy it  love it.,It never condescends  all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems.,1
It's PURE BRILLIANCE.,The two main characters may be two of the most believable children I ever saw put on screen.,1
This was a flick doomed from its conception.,They are so easy to love  but even more easy to identify with.,0
The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film  and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.,This movie is great--especially if you enjoy visual arts.,0
I wasn't the least bit interested.,The scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful.,0
Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic  but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment  every plot point  every joke is told in the trailer.,The story is also both funny and poignant at times.,0
But it's just not funny.,People who like European films and art movies will like this movie.,0
But even the talented Carrell can't save this.,This is truly an art movie--it actually has a lot of art in it.,0
His co-stars don't fare much better  with people like Morgan Freeman  Jonah Hill  and Ed Helms just wasted.,Go rent it.,0
The story itself is just predictable and lazy.,However  after finally watching this film  I realized that not only had I had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts  I also found myself watching it over and over again.,0
The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals  and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen.,It's the one movie that never ceases to interest me  simply because it keeps me alert  as I try to attempt to decipher it's meanings.,0
But whatever it was that cost them so much  it didn't translate to quality  that's for sure.,Brilliance indeed.,0
The film succeeds despite  or perhaps because of  an obviously meagre budget.,But if you liked movies like The Matrix (and better yet  their sequels) I think you'll appreciate the thought provoking  mindblowing experience this film will give you.,1
I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice  as a lesser film certainly would have.,Think of the film being like a dream.,1
In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written  French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.,Simply beautiful.,1
It's hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl.,Both Rickman and Stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who-- maybe?-- has written a subversive tract.,1
On the negative  it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.,It's a gloriously fun  fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver.,0
Long  whiny and pointless.,It presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives.,0
But I recommend waiting for their future efforts  let this one go.,Just whatever you do  avoid Groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about Human Traffic.,0
Excellent cast  story line  performances.,It's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share Crowe's level of dedication to quality  for if they did  we'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub-par mess.,1
Totally believable.,The movie seemed a little slow at first.,1
Anne Heche was utterly convincing.,But it picked up speed and got right to the point.,1
Sam Shepard's portrayal of a gung ho Marine was sobering.,It showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget.,1
I sat riveted to the TV screen.,I enjoyed it.,1
All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.,I have recommended it to friends.,1
I do think Tom Hanks is a good actor.,I was particularly pleased with the acting ability of Dwight Schultz.,1
I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.,Both actors truly understand and become their particular character  delivering a convincing  sincere performance.,1
I was very disappointed in the movie.,Their on-screen chemistry  critical to the entire film  is genuine.,0
One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.,The film's dialogue is natural  real to life.,0
There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.,The writer  Gorman Bechard  undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and character-age appropriate.,0
There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.,The incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film.,0
This movie totally grates on my nerves.,Each track commands sentiment  actually contributing to the scenes and characters.,0
The performances are not improved by improvisation  because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well  but whether the line itself is any good.,Definitely worth seeing? it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness.,0
And  quite honestly  often its not very good.,Hayao Miyazaki's latest and eighth film for Studio Ghibili  Gake No Ue No Ponyo (Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea) is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood.,0
Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another  or fit the surroundings.,At a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by Disney/Pixar's CGI masterpieces  it is both refreshing and comforting to know that Miyazaki is still relying on traditional hand-drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories.,0
It crackles with an unpredictable  youthful energy - but honestly  i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.,Enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film.,0
There are some generally great things in it.,The art style has the appearance of crayon/pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful.,1
I wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time  though.,If you act in such a film  you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible!,0
The suspense builders were good  & just cross the line from G to PG.,This one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 (Deep Impact and Armageddon)  and this one fails everywhere.,1
I especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies  I could predict the dialog verbatim  but the writing in this movie made better selections.,If you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end (by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue) you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time.,1
If you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills  this is a great choice.,Still  it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost.,1
Alexander Nevsky is a great film.,Just consider the excellent story  solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses.,1
He is an amazing film artist  one of the most important whoever lived.,Instead  we got a bore fest about a whiny  spoiled brat babysitting.,1
I'm glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn't do as planned by the Dodge stratus Big Shots... It's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained movie business of Québec.,Then I watched it again two Sundays ago (March 20th  2005) and I began to really enjoy it and this time I taped the entire thing.,0
This if the first movie I've given a 10 to in years.,It is a very well acted and done TV Movie.,1
If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote  this is it.,Judith Light is one of my favorite actresses and I think she does a superb job in this film!,1
Overall  the film is interesting and thought-provoking.,I keep watching it over and over.,1
Plus  it was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time.,It's a sad movie  but very good.,1
Give this one a look.,If you have not seen this movie  I definitely recommend it!,1
I gave it a 10,She is as lovely as usual  this cutie!,1
The Wind and the Lion is well written and superbly acted.,Still it's quite interesting and entertaining to follow.,1
It is a true classic.,;) Recommend with confidence!,1
It actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as B-list horror/suspense films go.,This movie is well-balanced with comedy and drama and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.,1
Definitely worth checking out.,It was a riot to see Hugo Weaving play a sex-obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming Darren (Tom Hollander).,1
The problem was the script.,:) Anyway  the plot flowed smoothly and the male-bonding scenes were a hoot.,0
It was horrendous.,The opening sequence of this gem is a classic  and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch.,0
There was NOTHING believable about it at all.,Fans of the genre will be in heaven.,0
The only suspense I was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were.,Lange had become a great actress.,0
MANNA FROM HEAVEN is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time.,It looked like a wonderful story.,1
The scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going.,I never walked out of a movie faster.,1
The cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip.,I just got bored watching Jessice Lange take her clothes off!,1
Ursula Burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church.,Unfortunately  any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script.,1
