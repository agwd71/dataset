A very  very  very slow-moving  aimless movie about a distressed  drifting young man.,The best part about Nurse Betty is it's unpredictability.,0
Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience  nearly half of whom walked out.,Director Neil LaBute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality  and along with the touching drama  and hilarious comedy  you can never tell what is going to happen next.,0
Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles  the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent.,Otherwise  don't even waste your time on this.,0
Very little music or anything to speak of.,This one just fails to create any real suspense.,0
The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head.,As for the killer  don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening.,1
The rest of the movie lacks art  charm  meaning... If it's about emptiness  it works I guess because it's empty.,There is  however  some pretty good acting (at least  for this type of film).,0
Wasted two hours.,I'm so sorry but I really can't recommend it to anyone.,0
Saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort  good messages for kids.,One of the most boring pointless movies I have ever seen.,1
A bit predictable.,The secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying.,0
Loved the casting of Jimmy Buffet as the science teacher.,Hated it.,1
And those baby owls were adorable.,This is one of the worst Sandra Bullock movie since Speed 2 But not quite that bad.,1
The movie showed a lot of Florida at it's best  made it look very appealing.,I don't understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store  it's not even a real movie!,1
The Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So Hilarious.,I highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash.,1
It Was So Cool.,This is not movie-making.,1
This is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face.,The acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book  that's how bad it is.,1
It had some average acting from the main person  and it was a low budget as you clearly can see.,So I am here to warn you--DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE  it is the dumbest thing you have never seen!,0
This review is long overdue  since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made.,I saw this short film on HBO the other day and absolutely loved it.,1
I'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay  cinematography  acting  post-production  editing  directing  or any other aspect of film-making.,I didn't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes.,1
It's practically perfect in all of them a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces.,Excellent short film.,1
